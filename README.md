# Movie Correlation Analysis and EDA using Python
This repository provides a movie correlation analysis and exploratory data analysis(EDA) using Python. This analysis aims to explore the relationships and correlation 


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie data, including information such as movie title, genre, ratings, and revenue. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Name
- Rating
- Genre
- Year
- Released
- Score
- Votes
- Director
- Writer
- Star
- Country
- Budget
- Gross
- Company
- Runtime


## Analysis

In this repository, I have implemented movie correlation analysis using Python and popular data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and seaborn. The code for performing the correlation analysis can be found in the `Correlation Analysis and EDA of Movie Industry.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Importing relevant libraries.
2. Loading, cleaning and preprocessing the movie dataset.
3. Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
4. Computing correlation coefficients between different movie attributes.
5. Visualizing the correlation matrix using heatmaps and scatter plots.

## Results

The Notebook provides visualizations and correlation coefficients to help us understand the impact of factors like budget and votes on movie revenue.
